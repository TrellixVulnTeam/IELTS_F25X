信息点：擅长工作的人
切入点1：职场升职得快，半年时间就从普通员工变成了公司中层或高层；
切入点2：取得了令人瞩目的成就，比如彻底地改变了某个地方人们的生活；
切入点3：完成了其他人未能完成的事情。

我要说的是我本科同学的爷爷。他是中国外交部的翻译。他的工作内容包括日文的文件、报纸和生命翻译成中文，以及陪同外交人员与日本代表会面，确保他们可以相互理解。
The person I am going to talk about is my friend's grandpa,
who is a translator working at the Chinese foreign ministry.
His job involves translating Japanese documents, newspapers,
and statements into Chinese as well as accompanying diplomatic
officials to meet Japanese representatives sa that they can
perfectly understand each other.

他已经从事这项工作三十年了。最初，他仅仅是个低级职员，在小隔间里工作，被成吨的文件所淹没。他处理的每一项文件都必须经过高级员工的检查以避免可能的错误。但现在，他已经有资格检查其他人的工作，并决定一些争议词汇和句子的具体翻译，以确保他们准确无误，并传达出本来的意思。
He has been doing this for over thirty years. At first, he was just a low-rank
employee, working at a small cell and buried by tons of papers.
Every document he had processed had to be checked by senior staff
to avoid potential mistakes. But now he is eligible to check others'
work and decide the specific translation of some controversial words
and sentences to make sure they are accurate and convey the original meaning.

做翻译一直都是我爷爷的梦想。他从小就展示出这方面的天赋。它能够轻易的抓住日语背后的语法规则，并在很短的时间内掌握它的发音。自然而然地，他上大学的时候选择日语作为自己的专业，并在毕业之后进入外交部。这是因为外交部是当时唯一招收日语翻译的地方。
Being a translator had always been his grandpa's dream and he had shown a gift
for this from quite an early age. He could easily grasp the grammatical rules
behind Japanese and master its pronunciation in a short time.
Naturally, he chose Japanese as his major when he entered college and enrolled
in the foreign ministry after graduation since it was the only department that
recruited Japanese translators back then.

我认为他爷爷在工作上取得的成功主要得益于它对该行业的热情。他真的很喜欢日语，并且享受翻译的过程。但他在查询了大量的资料，终于找到某个单词正确的翻译的时候，他会感到一种成就感而不是解脱。
I think the success of his grandpa has achieved in his job mainly result from
his passion for this career. He really loves Japanese and enjoys the process of
translating. When he finally finds the correct translation of a certain word
after a lot of consultation, he can feel a sense of achievement rather than relief.

外国名人

信息点：a foreign celebrity

我想要亲自见到的外国名人是汤姆汉克斯，他是一位非常有名的美国演员。
A foreign celebrity I would like to meet in person is Tom Hanks,
who is a very well-known American actor.

我从小就看着他的电影《阿甘正传》长大的。他在电影里面饰演一位头脑有些迟钝的人。我永远也不会忘记电影里头那段经典的台词“生活就像一盒巧克力，你永远也不知道下一颗你会拿到什么”。就在那个时期，我开始逐渐了解到他。
I grew up watching his movie Forrest Gump, in which he was
acting as a slow-witted man. I would never forget that
classic quote of the movie, "life is like a box of chocolate,
you never know what you're gonna get". It was during that period
of time that I started to know more about him.

他是一位非常努力工作的演员，即使现在他的名声早已远洋各个大陆。我记得我在Youtube上面看过他的一段在意大利弗罗伦萨的采访。那个时候，他非常忙碌，在准备《但丁密码》，是一部惊悚悬疑片。尽管他有很繁重的工作缠身，他还是特别乐意接受采访，而且面对观众表现出了他的人格魅力，让我感到很钦佩。
He is a very hardworking actor even though his fame has spread
to different continents. I remember I've watched a video clip on
Youtube about his interview in Florence, Italy. At that time, he was quite
busy preparing for the movie Inferno, which was a thriller. Despite being quite
engaged with the heavy workload there, he was willing to take the interview and
managed to show hi charming personality in front of the audiences, which was
quite admiring for me.

他现在依然坚持不懈的投身与电影行业，而且为人还很低调。最近也几乎没有看到他在媒体上有曝光。
He's now still putting himself into the movie industry relentlessly
and is being very low-key. You know, I hardly see much of his exposure to
the media recently.

我想要亲自见他一面的原因是因为他从我小时候开始就是我的楷模。如果能够在银幕背后见他一面，通过和他简单聊几句获得一些正能量就真的太棒了。
The reason why I desire to meet him in person is that he has been my role model
for years since my childhood. It will be great if I could meet the actual man
behind the scenes and get more positive energy from maybe chatting a little
bit with him.

助你实现目标的人
Describe a person who encouraged and helped you to achieve a goal
You should say:
Who this person is
What this person encouraged you to do
How this person helped you
And explain why this encouragement helped you to achieve the goal

信息点：助我实现目标的人。
首先有一个实际可行的目标并且完成了这个目标。因此，需要自动过滤掉那些漫无边际
以及还未完成的“远大理想”等等。
可以说短期目标（short-term goal）也可以说一个长远目标（long-term goal）.

成功地硕士毕业

一位帮助我实现目标的人是Prof.Xia，他是我的硕士研究生导师。
A person who encouraged and helped me to reach a goal is Professor Xia,
who is my postgraduate tutor in the past three years.

Prof. Xia是80后。他现在在重庆大学计算机学院当教授，是中国的一所985、211院校。
他非常随和并且非常努力，而且即便他的工作量很大，他也总是让人看起来觉得他每天精力充沛。
Prof.Xia is 80's generation. He is now working in the College of
Computer Science, Chongqing University, which is one of the 985 and
211 universities from China. He is easy-going and hardworking, and always
makes people feel that he is energetic every day though there's much
workload for him.

Prof. Xia从我在大四开始就成为了我的人生导师，成功地指导了我的本科毕业论文。
他对学生们都特别好，除了指导学术论文，还特别慷慨。如果学生的论文被出版商接收并发表，
他会从他的项目经费里面报销所有发表论文所需的花销，并给与学生一定的奖励，金额视论文的质量而定。
由于他是过来人，他能够在学习中和生活上给予我许多建议和细节的指导，这让我很感激。
Prof. Xia has always been my first mentor in my life since the first day I got
into the junior year of Chongqing University. As he is an experienced person,
he could give me a myriad of tips and detailed guidance on schooling and life
perspectives, which I feel grateful.

我记得有一次，是在我发表第一篇小论文的时候，这是硕士毕业的必备要求，Prof. Xia是我
能够依靠的人。我当时的目标就是达到硕士毕业的最低要求然后顺利毕业。当时发表小论文对
我来说最难，是最折磨我的事情。不知怎么的，我就是不太能够将算法的实验结果运行出来。
由于他经历过这些，他尽力给我关于科技论文写作的指导。经过不断的修改，我的第一篇小论文
最终被SCC录用了。
I remember there was a time when I was preparing for a paper, which is the
minimum requirement for a Master's degree, Prof. Xia was the person I could
fall back on. My goal was to nail it so that I could participate in Master's
defense. You know, writing a scientific paper was a horrible thing that tormented
me the most. I just somehow couldn't figure out ideal experimental results
of the algorithm. Since he has been through this, he constantly consoled me
and gave me instruction as much as he could. After constantly improving it,
my first conference paper was accepted and successfully published by SCC 2018.

我觉得他的指导起作用的原因就是他是我的楷模。虽然他当时所处的情况不一样，
但是这种建设性的建议和鼓励让我坚持了下来。
The reason why I felt his suggestions worked was that my supervisor was a
role model for me. You know, although he was not in the same situation,
his constructive advice and encouragement enabled me to carry on.
