我要说的是我本科同学的爷爷。他是中国外交部的翻译。他的工作内容包括日文的文件、报纸和生命翻译成中文，以及陪同外交人员与日本代表会面，确保他们可以相互理解。
The person I am going to talk about is my friend's grandpa,
who is a translator working at the Chinese foreign ministry.
His job involves translating Japanese documents, newspapers,
and statements into Chinese as well as accompanying diplomatic
officials to meet Japanese representatives sa that they can
perfectly understand each other.

他已经从事这项工作三十年了。最初，他仅仅是个低级职员，在小隔间里工作，被成吨的文件所淹没。他处理的每一项文件都必须经过高级员工的检查以避免可能的错误。但现在，他已经有资格检查其他人的工作，并决定一些争议词汇和句子的具体翻译，以确保他们准确无误，并传达出本来的意思。
He has been doing this for over thirty years. At first, he was just a low-rank
employee, working at a small cell and buried by tons of papers.
Every document he had processed had to be checked by senior staff
to avoid potential mistakes. But now he is eligible to check others'
work and decide the specific translation of some controversial words
and sentences to make sure they are accurate and convey the original meaning.

做翻译一直都是我爷爷的梦想。他从小就展示出这方面的天赋。它能够轻易的抓住日语背后的语法规则，并在很短的时间内掌握它的发音。自然而然地，他上大学的时候选择日语作为自己的专业，并在毕业之后进入外交部。这是因为外交部是当时唯一招收日语翻译的地方。
Being a translator had always been his grandpa's dream and he had shown a gift
for this from quite an early age. He could easily grasp the grammatical rules
behind Japanese and master its pronunciation in a short time.
Naturally, he chose Japanese as his major when he entered college and enrolled
in the foreign ministry after graduation since it was the only department that
recruited Japanese translators back then.

我认为他爷爷在工作上取得的成功主要得益于它对该行业的热情。他真的很喜欢日语，并且享受翻译的过程。但他在查询了大量的资料，终于找到某个单词正确的翻译的时候，他会感到一种成就感而不是解脱。
I think the success of his grandpa has achieved in his job mainly result from
his passion for this career. He really loves Japanese and enjoys the process of
translating. When he finally finds the correct translation of a certain word
after a lot of consultation, he can feel a sense of achievement rather than relief.
