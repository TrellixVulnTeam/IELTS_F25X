我要说的是我本科同学的爷爷。他是中国外交部的翻译。他的工作内容包括日文的文件、报纸和生命翻译成中文，以及陪同外交人员与日本代表会面，确保他们可以相互理解。
The person I am going to talk about is my friend's grandpa, who is a translator working at the Chinese foreign ministry. His job involves translating Japanese documents, newspapers, and statements into Chinese as well as accompanying diplomatic officials to meet Japanese representatives as that they can perfectly understand each other.

He has been doing this for over thirty years. At first, he was just a low-rank employee, working at a small cell and buried by tons of papers. Every document he had processed had to be checked by senior staff to avoid potential mistakes. But now he is eligible to check others' work and decide the specific translation of some controversial words and sentences to make sure they are accurate and convey the original meaning.

From my friend told me that, being a translator had always been his grandpa's dream and he had shown a gift for this from quite an early age. He could easily grasp the grammatical rules behind Japanese and master its pronunciation in a short time. Naturally, he chose Japanese as his major when he entered college and enrolled in the foreign ministry after graduation since it was the only department that recruited Japanese translators back then.

I think the success of his grandpa has achieved in his job mainly result from his passion for this career. He really loves Japanese and enjoys the process of translating. When he finally finds the correct translation of a certain word after a lot of consultation, he can feel a sense of achievement rather than relief.

经常坐飞机的人

一个经常坐飞机的人是我的朋友。
A person who often travels by plane is my friend, Qingqing.

My friend Qingqing is now working for an airline airway as a cabin crew who is mainly responsible for guaranteeing passengers to feel safe and comfortable in the plane. As you can tell from her title. It involves a lot of international air travel. It's like most of her time in a year has been spent on air trips.

The airline company that my friend works for has many international flights all around the globe. So, there're countless destinations for her to travel to while she's working, for example, Europe, North America, and Southeast Asia. But, from my observation, the U.S is the place that she flew to the most because their company has a strong tie to the American market even though there's a tension now between China and the U.S..

Well, the reason why she travels by plane is that the aeroplane is the place of her daily work. You know, plane as the most efficient means of transportation, it only takes less than a day to go to any place around this world. Thus it is very popular in the public.

In my friend's eyes, air travel is not uncommon, and not something she's quite passionate about, but a choice she has to choose because of the work. By that I mean, she doesn't hate it.

一位外语说得很好的人是我朋友的爷爷，他懂得很多俄语。
Well, a person who speaks a good foreign language is my friend's grandfather who knows much about Russian.

His grandfather was a soldier in the early People's Republic of China. He learned Russian during his service in the army. You know he was a military reporter and needed to translate the news from Russia. To my surprise, he didn't seem to have got his Russian language training in a professional school like what we do nowadays but rather taught himself, which was quite amazing for me. You know how hard that learning curve would be without any instructional technology like APPs or even computers during that time.

According to what my friend told me, the biggest motivation for his grandfather to learn Russian wasn't the income or something like that. It was purely because he really wanted to bring as much information as possible from Russia to China so that our country could have more opportunities to develop. You know he was being quite patriotic.

Well, one of the reasons why I think he speaks so good Russian is that he has the determination of learning the language well. You know he is never afraid of losing motivation when failures come. Also, I think he always had an interest in knowing something about languages. That interest also gives him the momentum of delving deeper into this language.

我想要讲到的是一个我在重庆沙坪坝三峡广场的一个书店（西西弗书店）购物时遇到的一位搞笑的小女孩儿的事情。
I would like to talk about a time I saw a funny little girl while I was shopping at SISYPHE bookstore in Shapingba District, Chongqing.

I can't remember the exact date when I visit there, but I am sure that it's after the last Mid-Autumn Festival, probably in the first week or the second week of the 15th of August according to Chinese lunar calendar.

I was at the SISYPHE bookstore, which was one of the well-known bookstores in that district. You know such a national bookstore chain, had quite an array of books in different disciplines, which was why I often go there to find something that I needed for both my schoolwork and leisure. That day was a little bit interesting because there were more novels and cartoon booklets on sale at the same main hall. Because of this, the bookstore had gathered lots of readers there. I was not an exception and got into the crowd and started reading some of those books.

It was during that time, I saw a little girl, around six or seven years old, with her father looking for some books. The girl picked up a book to read, and little did I know that it was a small book of dirty jokes. Just as I was about to leave, I heard that girl asking her dad: "What's the meaning of XXX?" The last word she blurted out was so erotic and somewhat nasty. I was literally about to laugh out loud. The thing was that there were several readers near us, and all of them started quietly chuckling, which made the situation quite hilarious.

Well, the reason why I laughed was that this situation made her father difficult to give an explanation to his daughter. You know, this innocent girl actually knew nothing about the word, nor did she understand that dirty joke, but all of us nearby actually did. And if the girl knew it as well, I think that would be even more embarrassing.

我想要亲自见到的外国名人是汤姆汉克斯，他是一位非常有名的美国演员。
A foreign celebrity I would like to meet in person is Tom Hanks, who is a very well-known American actor.

I grew up watching his movie Forrest Gump, in which he was acting as a slow-witted man. I would never forget that classic quote of the movie, "life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you're gonna get". It was during that period of time that I started to know more about him.

He is a very hardworking actor even though his fame has spread to different continents. I remember I've watched a video clip on Youtube about his interview in Florence, Italy. At that time, he was quite busy preparing for the movie Inferno, which was a thriller. Despite being quite engaged with the heavy workload there, he was willing to take the interview and managed to show his charming personality in front of the audiences, which was quite admiring for me.

He's now still putting himself into the movie industry relentlessly and is being very low-key. You know, I hardly see much of his exposure to the media recently.

The reason why I desire to meet him in person is that he has been my role model for years since my childhood. It will be great if I could meet the actual man behind the scenes and get more positive energy from maybe chatting a little bit with him.

***
我想说的一个我非常喜欢的歌手之一是亚当·兰伯特，他是一名美国的流行音乐歌手。
Well, one of my favourite singers that I would like to talk about is Adam Lambert, who is an American pop song singer.

Adam Lambert, as you probably know, was the runner-up in the 2009 American Idol, which was the most popular singing TV talent show in the U.S or even around the world during that year.

I probably knew him from the very first episode of the TV show. At that time, he had a very easy-going personality while talking to the host, friends and the judges. He sang pretty well, and literally rocked the studio. You know, even though he has won immense praise from both the judges and the audiences, he was always being humble and willing to try new styles in singing and stage performance.

Well, I feel that he has his unique way of singing, sort of a combination of the opera genre with a pop song style. Most of his songs in the earlier series of the competition were about opera style, partly because he was an active singer in the opera while he was a child.

I think one of the reasons why he is the singer that I'm quite keen on is that he has the singing talent that almost nobody has in the entertainment circle. You know he has such a beautiful and wide range of vocal sounds, which is amazing to listen to. Also, I like his personality, you know he never cares much about other people's unreasonable criticism and always sticks to his passion. I wish I could attend his concert in the future.

我想讲述的一位经常帮助他人的人是Yu Ke，他是我在重庆大学研究生院里头的一位学长。
Well, a person who often gives a hand to others that I would like to say is actually Yu Ke, who is a fellow student of mine in graduate school of Chongqing University.

Yu is a super kind person who often does a favour to anyone he meets on campus and even in life. This often makes me feel like he is a living Bodhisattva英 /ˌbɒdɪˈsɑːtvə/, making contributions to others while expecting no rewards.
Yu and I are both students majoring in Computer Sciences which is actually not that easy for me to grasp. You know he was always the first guy who helped me out in my learning curve. I clearly remember there was a time that he even burnt the midnight oil helping me to make up for the lesson that I missed after I had finished my sick leave, which made me so touched.

Well, I think the reason why Yu Ke is always ready to help others is that he has a pretty good philosophy that guides him to be kind and generous to people. He believes that to help people is to help himself, which I strongly agree with.

I feel truly grateful for having a friend like this, and he is definitely the kindest person I have met in college.

******
一位帮助我实现目标的人是Prof.Xia，他是我的硕士研究生导师。
A person who encouraged and helped me to reach a goal is Professor Xia, who is my postgraduate tutor in the past three years.

Prof.Xia is 80's generation. He is now working in the College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, which is one of the 985 and 211 universities from China. He is easy-going and always makes people feel that he is energetic every day though there's much workload for him.

Prof.Xia has always been my first mentor in my life since the first day I got into the senior year of Chongqing University. During that time, I'd been taking his professional course, the Algorithm, I was impressed by his ideas of teaching, and naturally, I chose him as an adviser for my undergraduate thesis in 2016. And this year, I successfully finished my Master degree dissertation at Chongqing University under his supervision. As he is an experienced person, he could give me a myriad of tips and detailed guidance on schooling and life perspectives, which I feel grateful.

He is pretty nice and generous to all his students, and always encouraging his students to study for a PhD degree. Plus, he always funds students for publishing scientific or academic papers on journals or magazines, including the page charge as well as attending some international conferences from his project fundings.

I remember there was a time when I was working for a scientific paper, which is the minimum requirement for a Master's degree, Prof. Xia was the person I could fall back on. My goal was to nail it so that I could qualify for a Master's thesis defence. You know, writing a scientific paper was a horrible thing that tormented me the most. I just somehow couldn't figure out ideal experimental results of the algorithm. Since he has been through this, he constantly consoled me and gave me instruction as much as he could, like adjusting the paprameters. After constantly improving it, my first conference paper was accepted by SCC 2018 and successfully published by Springer.

The reason why I felt his suggestions worked was that my supervisor was a role model for me. You know, although he was not in the same situation, his constructive advice and encouragement enabled me to carry on.

我想要讲述的是我的一位朋友，他的名字叫Yang Ping。Yang和我从大学的时候就是很好的朋友I would like to talk about a friend of mine whose name is Yang Ping. Yang and I have been intimate friends since our Chongqing university. He's now a CEO since he started a business of smart home, including both software and hardware products. Before that, he was a software engineer serving for the HUAWEI Company in Chengdu.

I knew him because he was my classmate at Chongqing University. He got class A in almost all professional courses and was proficient in practical skills, like software programming. He was also the chairman of the association for science and technology in College of Computer Science. I remember there was a time at Programming Practice course, I saw him developed the first function of the project in a short time. And, he could instantly check where my code was wrong and solve the problem.

Recently, he developed an applet of WeChat and a smart box he designed for controlling all kinds of household appliances, such as lights, fan, television, air conditioner and so forth via WIFI, far infrared ray device as well as blue-tooth signals. It was the first product for his company, which worked perfectly in my house. You know, all parts of the product are DIY from him, he owns the proprietary intellectual property rights. Honestly, he has had the idea of doing smart-device in IoT for a long time. What I admire him is that he's not just talking for that, but persists in achieving his ideas and trying to constantly optimize them. It lets me remind a sentence in our field, “talk is cheap, show me the code”, haha.

Well, I think the reason why his ideas are interesting is that he considered all kinds of core technology in the IoT area, as well as the global perspective for products. You know, those ideas are key parts in managing a company. From the way of his start-up, I got inspiration from him and have gone on my own path in my career.
