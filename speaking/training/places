一个改善了周边环境的新设施是我家附近的音乐喷泉广场，今年年初刚刚整修好。
A new public facility which improves my local area is the Music Fountain Square of my hometown, which has just been renovated this year.

This square is actually located at the Beibin Road of Wanzhou District, which is a waterfront nearby Yangzi River. This place is quite near to the place where I live. It's probably ten minutes' walk from my home to the square. So, I often went there to unwind after work.

This place has many different areas of creation like the pier for boating, and some small square for seniors go square dancing. But, only the newly furnished music fountain has met the needs of all residents ranging from the kids to the old. You can expect excitement brought by colourful lights, dynamic music and fountains with different movements, high and low. Most of the time, I saw more children than adults played there during the weekdays, but the whole area usually got filled with people of different ages during the weekends. There were lots of people laughing and jubilating, which was an extremely joyful scene.

Well, I think the Music Fountain Square has brought a lot of benefits to the residents nearby. It provides a great opportunity for families to gather together and to spend some quality time there. You see, lots of people are busy working or studying in this city, they don't have many near places to relax. Now, they have one more good option!

提到一个读书写字的地方，我脑海中第一想到的就是我们学校的大学城虎溪校区的一个图书馆，叫做重庆大学虎溪校区图书馆。
Speaking of a place that I read and write, the first thing that pops up into my mind is one of the libraries in my university called HuXi Library.

It is located in the Northern part of HUXI campus which looks like a red piano. It has been regarded as the landmark for all pedestrians for decades. If you visit my university, you cannot miss it.

When I was an undergraduate student, I went there pretty much every day to either finish my assignments or do some extra readings there. There's an area in that library building that gave us some private study rooms, which I think is perfect for group discussion.

Usually, I went there alone during the weekends. But, if it's in the weekdays, my roommates who were also my classmates went there with me because we could team up to help each other in our studies.

I feel this place is wonderful. The reason why I think this is second to none on campus is that it has more volumes of books compared to other libraries, which allows me to check out the most crucial references for my studies whenever I want.

我打算告诉你我13、14年前上的小学。
I am going to tell you about my primary school which I attended like 13 or 14 years ago, called Wan Shi Fu Xiao. It was located in the countryside of my hometown. Several bungalows were scattered around the school, and the teaching building with 6 floors, was the highest building in the area.

The school's history can be traced back to 30 years ago, and it had not been renovated ever since. So as you can imagine, the facilities were quite out of date. There was no football field, no basketball court, let alone the plastic racetracks. And the playground was basically an open field with wild grasses and flowers.

I finished my primary education there, learning basic mathematics, Chinese, Science and so on. I should say the study there laid a firm foundation for my further education. Teachers helped me find the amusement of studying and reading, which turned me into a self-motivated and enthusiastic student.

一个我记忆深刻的多彩之地是四川美术学院的一栋建筑物，去年那会儿我正好和朋友在这里参观画展。
A colourful place that I remember well is a building of the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute while I was hanging out with my friends last year.

It is located at Xijie Street of Universities' City, which is pretty much remarkable because of its colourful appearance.

Its outward appearance was covered with broken pieces of pottery, with different colours separating it into a variety of regular areas, such as trees full of fruits, birds as well as kids.

Its main purpose was for the art exhibition, and I didn't even know that it had just been converted into an art exhibition several months before we were hanging out at Xijie Street. It was not big. But, once I was inside the room, I felt like it's spacious enough for people to take a walk. Besides, it was free for public visiting. The most fascinating thing about this place was that it was equipped with a mess of broken ceramics that formed into various meaningful images by a myriad of colourful fragments. At first, I felt it was just dazzling, but once I was fully immersed in the pictures, I felt like I was deeply stunned and couldn't stop the feeling.

Well, I think the reason why I remember it well is that the countless colourful broken ceramics effect was just so amazing while we were visiting the weather is pretty nice. That's probably the most impressive and enjoyable time I have ever had when being to an art exhibition.

我要告诉你的公园叫照母山森林公园，位于重庆市渝北区的西南方向。
The park I am going to tell you is called Zhaomu Mountain Forest Park. It is located to the southwest of the Yubei District, Chongqing.

Like many other Chinese parks, a large lake is there nearby the Renhe light rail station, with calm and glinted water under the sun. People can go for a walk along it. When summer comes, the lake will be covered by lotus leaves and you can smell the fragrance of lotus from quite a distance. Paths stretch out from the lake, separating it into a variety of irregular areas. Flowers, trees are scattered in some of them. According to the notice board, there are many different kinds of flowers and trees there, as well as some slogans for healthy lifestyles like how to do physical exercises. Zhaomu is the homophone of Zhaomu(赵墓) in Chinese, which means the Zhao's tomb. That is where it gets its name. Other areas are constructed as small lawns. There, you can always see families enjoying their camping, children chasing each other, and some people flying kites.

Although the park is about 30 minutes' away to where I live, I often do jogging around the lake to keep fit, by twice a week, mostly in the morning for one hour from 7 am to 8 am. Sometimes, when I come back from work pretty exhausted, I will also take a stroll there or simply sit on benches, or lawns, trying to wind myself down.

I really love this park. It provides a heaven to escape the crowded city life and endless work. What's more important is that the circle of this park is about 10 KM, which is an ideal place for me to train half marathon.
