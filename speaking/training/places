我想要谈论的我经常读写的地方是我研究生经常学习/工作的地方，它位于重庆大学A区主教1618实验室/办公室。
重庆大学A区主教学楼是重大最高的建筑物，外观上看上去像一个立着的U盘.
它的内部很普通。每个研究生都有一个专有座位，并配有台式电脑/显示屏和插线板。
我通常会在我的座位上放一些专业书籍、打印好的重点看的论文集以及放松时看的一些兴趣书、笔袋、水杯以及茶叶。
在研究生期间，我没添都会去实验室，要么写作业，要么看论文、写实验代码和写论文，主要心思进本上都放在了学习上了。
因为一个师门的同学都在这个实验室，所以也少不了和大家的交流、合作。
我对这个地方的感情很深，即使我已经毕业了但是还是很怀念当初勤奋的自己，以及和实验室的朋友们。

I'd like to talk about my previous office before I graduated from the College of Computer Science, Chongqing University.
My office is located at room 1618, the Main Teaching Building, between the Si Qun Square and the Feng Yu Gymnasium.
It's the highest building in Campus A, and its outward appearance looks like an upside down with the flash card.
My seat is on the second row nearby the big window, with standard features as a postgraduate. You can see a desktop,
computer screen,keyboard, a mouse on the table, in addition to an ordinary chair.
When I was a postgraduate student, I almost go to the office every day.
I usually put my textbooks, some printed copies of important papers on the table. Besides, there were my cup and packaged tea.
I think this place is significantly meaningful for me, because it recorded my memories of the whole periods of being a postgraduate student.
I read much and write much at this place, as well as did many experiments for my thesis.
