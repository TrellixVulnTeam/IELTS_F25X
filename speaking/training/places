信息点：a place where you read and write(not your home)

提到一个读书写字的地方，我脑海中第一想到的就是我们学校的大学城虎溪校区的一个图书馆，叫做重庆大学虎溪校区图书馆。
Speaking of a place that I read and write, the first thing that pops up into my mind is one
of the libraries in my university named HuXi Library.

这个图书馆位于我们学校新校区的正北部位，而且自新校区建好之后一直都被人们视为路标。如果你来我们大学参观，你一定不会错过它。
It is located in the Northern part of our HUXI campus, and has been regarded as the landmark
for all pedestrians for decades. If you visit my university, you cannot miss it.

当我读本科的时候，我每天都去那里，要么去完成我的作业要么就是做一些额外的阅读。在图书馆里有那么一个区域为我们提供了私人学习房间，我觉得非常适合小组讨论。
When I was an undergraduate student, I went there pretty much every day to either finish my
assignments or do some extra readings there. There's an area in that library building that
gave us some private study rooms, which I think is perfect for group discussion.

通常情况下，我会在周末的时候独自一人去图书馆。但是，如果在工作日的话，我的室友也是我的同学会和我一起去那里，因为我们能组团在学习上相互帮助。
Usually, I went there alone during the weekends. But, if it's in the weekdays, my roommates
who were also my classmates went there with me because we could team up to help each other
in our studies.

我觉得这个地方非常棒。我觉得这个地方独一无二的原因是它的藏书量相比于其它校内的图书馆要多很多，并且资料很很新，这样能让我不管什么时候都可以查阅到学习上重要的文献。
I feel this place is wonderful. The reason why I think this is second to none on campus is
that it has more volumes of books compared to other libraries, which allows me to check out
the most crucial references for my studies whenever I want.

童年学校
Describe a school you went to in your childhood
You should say:
Where it was

学校不同，回答的时候的侧重点自然也会不同。如果学校最近刚刚建成，大家可以重点描述其设备的先进、设施的完善。如果学校已经建成很久了，大家一方面可以吐槽其设施的陈旧性，另一方面也可以强调其悠久的传统。如果学校很好，大家可以多说说曾经的毕业生；如果学校较差，大家可以聊聊纪律的散乱。并不是说非要说好话才行。

我打算告诉你我13、14年前上的小学。它位于郊外乡下，非常偏僻，几座平房散步在周围，而6层楼的学校是那个区域最高的建筑。它其实是我们当地的一所师范类院校的附属小学，叫“万师附小”。
I am going to tell you about my primary school which I attended like 18 or 19 years ago,
called Wan Shi Fu Xiao. It was located on the countryside. Several bungalows were scattered
around the school, with 6 floors, was the highest building in the area.

学校的历史可以追溯到20年前，从那之后就从来没有被翻修过。所以你可以想象，设施已经十分陈旧了。没有足球场，没有篮球场，更不用说塑胶跑道了。操场基本上就是片空地，上面还有野草和野花。
The school's history can be traced back to 30 years ago, and it had not been renovated ever
since. So as you can imagine, the facilities were quite out of date. There was no football
field, no basketball court, let alone the plastic racetracks. And the playground was basically
an open field with wild grasses and flowers.

我在那完成了我的小学教育，学习基础的数学、语文、自然科学等学科。我可以说那里的学习为我之后的教育打下了坚实的基础。老师帮我找到学习和阅读的乐趣所在，将我变成一个动力十足、十分热心学习的学生。
I finished my primary education there, learning basic mathematics, Chinese, Science and so
on. I should say the study there laid a firm foundation for my further education. Teachers
helped me find the amusement of studying and reading, which turned me into a self-motivated,
enthusiastic student.

多彩的地方
Describe a place you remember well that is full of colors
You should say:
Where it is
What it is like

And explain why you remember it well

信息点：a colorful place

一个我记忆深刻的多彩之地是四川美术学院的一栋建筑物，去年那会儿我正好和朋友在这里参观画展。
A colorful place that I remember well is a building of Sichuan Fine Arts Institute while I
was visiting the art exhibition with my friends last year.

它位于大学城，邻近熙街，非常引人注目。
It is located at Xijie Street of Universities' City, which is pretty much remarkable.

这栋建筑内部是一个美术展览馆，它的外部墙壁上被贴满了五颜六色的瓷砖碎片，但是通过颜色区分出一些线条轮廓，整体来看是有图案的。
Its outward appearance was covered with broken pieces of China, with different colors
separating it into a variety of regular areas, such as trees full of fruits, birds as
well as some children chasing each other.

这个地方的主要功能是用来举行艺术展览的，我甚至不知道在我们逛街经过熙街的时候这是一个艺术展览馆。最让我觉得这个地方很吸引人的一点就是它外部的无数五颜六色的碎瓷片，随着不同颜色的瓷片的组合形成了各种各样有意义的图案。一开始，我觉得只是比较耀眼，但是一旦我浸入这个环境/意境之后，我就觉得我非常欣喜若狂，完全被吸引了。
Its main purpose was for the art exhibition, and I didn't even know that it had just been
converted into an art exhibition several months before we were hanging out at Xijie Street.
It was not big. But, once I was inside the room, I felt like it's spacious enough for people
to take a walk. Besides, it was free for public visiting. The most fascinating thing about
this place was that it was equipped with a mess of broken ceramics that formed into various
meaningful pictures by a myriad of colorful fragments. At first, I felt it was just dazzling,
but once I was fully immersed in the pictures, I felt like I was deeply stunned and couldn't
stop the feeling.

我认为我对此地记忆犹新的原因是当我们在那里参观时，那时的天气特别好。大概是我目前印象最深刻的艺术展览馆了。
Well, I think the reason why I remember it well is that the light effect was just so amazing
while we were visiting the weather is pretty nice. That's probably the most impressive and
enjoyable time I have ever had when being to a art exhibition.

公园
Describe a park/garden you like visiting
You should say:
Where the park is
When you visit it
What the park is like

信息点：a prk/garden you like visiting

我要告诉你的公园叫照母山森林公园，位于重庆市渝北区的西南方向。通常，我从学校（沙正街站）乘坐环线到冉家坝站，然后转6号线到光电园站出轻轨站，再步行大概10分钟就可以到达照母山森林公园的入口了。
The park I am going to tell you is called Zhaomu Mountain Forest Park. It is located to the
southwest of the district Yubei of Chongqing.

像中国的许多公园一样，它里面有一个巨大的湖，靠近人和轻轨站。阳光照射下，湖广闪闪发光。夏天的时候，湖面会被荷叶覆盖，离很远就可以闻到荷花的香气。小路以湖为中心向周围展开，将公园分割成不规则的区块。其中一些点缀着花花草草。根据说明栏，这些花草有几十个种类。照母是“赵墓”的同音字，这儿以前是赵氏的墓地。这也是它名字的由来。另外一些则空着作为草坪，会有家庭，小孩追跑打闹，偶尔也会有人放风筝。
Like many other Chinese parks, a large lake is nearby the Renhe light rail station, with
calm and glinted water under the sun. People can go for a walk along it. When summer comes,
the lake will be covered by lotus leaves and you can smell the fragrance of lotus from quite
a distance. Paths stretch out from the lake, separating it into a variety of irregular areas.
Flowers, trees are scattered in some of them. According to the notice board, there are many
different kinds of flowers and trees there. But I cannot tell what the exact name for each
kind of plant. Zhaomu（照母） is the homophone of Zhaomu（赵墓）, where was the Zhao's tomb.
That is where it gets its name. Other areas are constructed as small lawns. There, you can
always see families enjoying their camping, children chasing each other, and some people flying kites.

即使它离我住的地方差不多有30分钟的路程，但是我经常到那里慢跑，保持身体健康，一周两次，每次持续1个小时，通常是早上7点到8点。有时候，在一天精疲力尽的工作之后，我也会到里面散步，在长椅上或草坪上坐一会，放空自己。这是一种很好的放松方式。
Although the park is about 30 minutes' away to where I live, I often do jogging around the
lake to keep fit, by twice a week, mostly in the morning for one hour from 7am to 8am.
Sometimes, when I come back from work pretty exhausted, I will take a stroll there or simply
sit on one of the benches, or lawns, trying to wind myself down.

我很喜欢这个公园，它给我提供了一个逃离城市拥挤生活和工作的地方。更重要的事，它让我可以作为训练女子马拉松的场地，这个公园一圈大概有10公里，刚好可以训练半马或全马。
I really love this park. It provides a heaven to escape the crowded city life and endless work.
What's more important is that the circle of this park is about 10 KM, which is an ideal place
for me to train half marathon.
