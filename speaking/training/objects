核心信息点：1）你喜欢的picture/photograph；2）在你的房间
你可以瞅瞅自己梳妆台或者墙上有没有放着照片。可以是多年的朋友聚会、家庭聚会的照片，也可以是外出旅行拍下的游客照，言之有理即可。

一张我房间内喜欢的照片是几年前和我父母一起照的艺术照。
A picture that I enjoy in my room is actually an artsy shot taken several years ago
with my parents.

如果我没有记错的话，我们是在2016年的夏天拍的，那个时候我刚好结束了我的本科校园生活。我的父母想着我马上升上研究生，离开他们去另一个城市上学了，就特想拍一张棒棒的照片来记录我们在一起的记忆。另外，我们之前也没有很像样的拍过照片。所以，这次应该是一个很好的尝试。
If my memory's correct, it's taken during the summer in 2016 when I just finished
my undergraduate campus life. My parents thought that I was gonna leave them for
postgraduate school in another city and really wanted to take a good photo to kind
of record our memory being together. Plus, we hadn't really taken serious photos
before. So, it would be a nice try.

我母亲觉得我这是我们第一次拍照，那就要拍好。所以，我们在网上搜索的信息然后找到了一家在我们市内评价最好的摄影店。这家摄影店位于我们市的商业中心区。它距离我们当时居住的地方有点远。所以，我父亲就开车带我们去，大概花了20分钟左右的样子。
My mom thought that we should go get the perfect photo since it's our first time.
So, we searched for the information online and found a photo shop that's rated the
top in our city. The shop was located right in the central business district of our
city. It's a little bit far away from where we were living. So, my father drove us
to the shop, which took us around 20 minutes.

照片其实就是一张全家福。在那张照片里头，我父亲穿着正装，我母亲穿着裙子，我穿着学士服、戴着学士帽。听起来很正式对吧？但是，我们那是其实摆了很搞笑的姿势。
You know, it was actually a family portrait. In that picture, my father was wearing
formal clothes. My mother were wearing red dress, and I just was dressing in my cap
and gown. It sounds very formal, right? But, we were actually having funny poses.

我很喜欢这个照片的原因是这是我第一次和家人一起开心的拍艺术照。我知道准备化妆、衣服和姿势的过程是很累人的。但是那次是我人生中一次难忘的经历。
Well, the reason why I am quite into this picture is that it's the first that I was
having fun with my family taking an artistic photo. I knew it's tiring while preparing
the makeups, costumes, and gestures. But, that's really an unforgettable experience in
my life.

这里要求的使用技能可以是非常贴近生活并提升生活质量的技能，比如会心算；
手机贴膜、系鞋带打领带等技能。女生们美妆的技能。

一个我最近掌握的技能是驾驶，我才这个技能在我出国读书的时候是非常重要的。
A practical skill that I have mastered recently is driving, which is quite important I
guess when I go abroad to further my studies.

这是一个C1驾驶照，能够让我作为一个有资格的司机在路上开车。我是在我们大学的附属驾校学习的这门技能。那是在去年暑假那会儿。我清楚地记得那是一个非常闷热的七月份。我们得考一系列的考试包括理论知识测试以及两个上路考试。驾驶训练密度强，而且教练还有点不耐烦，对我们比较严格。我不得不认真地听从指导，并没添顶着太阳联系不低于两小时的时间。让我觉得比较困难的是我不得不在旁边排很长的时间才能轮到我练习。有点点浪费时间。不管怎样，经过不懈努力我还是通过了整个考试。
It's a C1 driving license that enables me to drive on the road as a qualified driver.
I learned this skill at the driving school affiliated to my university in Chongqing last
summer. I clearly remember it was a sultry July. We were supposed to sit for a series of
exams, including the knowledge test and two road tests. The training was intensive and
the coach was somewhat impatient and strict to us. I had to follow his instruction attentively
and practiced it at least two hours under the sun every day. What's made me feel difficult
was that I had to stand by and wait for my turn for a long time, which was time-consuming.
Anyway, I managed to pass this whole test with my effort and time.

我认为我学习这项驾驶技能的原因是因为我知道如果我去了澳洲这个我要出国留学的地方。我估计要开车。几乎所有去那边学习或成活过的朋友们都告诉我那个国度驾车是如何重要。车辆就好像是我们的第二双腿，没有的话你去不了远的地方。
The reason why I learned this driving skill is that I would be driving in Australia, which
is the destination for my study abroad. You know, nearly every friend who has studied or
lived there told me how important it is to be able to drive in that nation. It's like a
vehicle is your second feet without which you can't go farther.

我非常高兴我能够掌握这个技能。我知道我去澳洲之后需要过另外一个驾驶考试，但是我认为应该不难，因为我已经至少能合格驾驶了。
I'm really glad that I have mastered this driving skill. I know I will need to pass another
driving test in Australia, but I think it's would be a piece of cake since I am at least
qualified for driving here.
