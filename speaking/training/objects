一张我房间内喜欢的照片是几年前和我父母一起照的艺术照。
A picture that I enjoy in my room is actually an artsy shot taken several years ago with my parents.

If my memory's correct, it's taken during the summer in 2016 when I just finished my undergraduate campus life. My parents thought that I was gonna leave them for postgraduate school in another city and really wanted to take a good photo to kind of record our memory being together. Plus, we hadn't really taken serious photos before. So, it would be a nice try.

My mom thought that we should go get the perfect photo since it's our first time. So, we searched for the information online and found a photo shop that's rated the top in our city. The shop was located right in the central business district of our city. It's a little bit far away from where we were living. So, my father drove us to the shop, which took us around 20 minutes.

You know, it was actually a family portrait. In that picture, my father was wearing formal clothes. My mother was wearing a red dress, and I just was dressing in my cap and gown. It sounds very formal, right? But, we were actually having funny poses.

Well, the reason why I am quite into this picture is that it's the first that I was having fun with my family taking an artistic photo. I knew it's tiring while preparing the makeups, costumes, and gestures. But, that's really an unforgettable experience in my life.

我想讲一讲我几个月前去四川四姑娘山做志愿者时看到的天空。
I would like to talk about the sky that I have watched while I was volunteering at Mountain. Siguniang of Sichuan several months ago.

I saw the sky at the Mt.Siguniang town where there's a perfect spot for starry observation. I went there with other volunteers from Baicao Road station of Chengdu this July. We started our journey in summer, which was perfect timing to appreciate the starry sky.

We actually not only saw countless shining stars that gave us a clear picture of what the Milky Way looked like, but also the exotic flowers and rare herbs in the daytime. You know this was the first time I saw this stunning scene. The entire night sky in Mt.Siguniang town was so gorgeous. The countless stars scattered around made an artistic masterpiece.

I felt like that was the most impressive night sky I have watched in my life. The reason why I thought it gave me such a deep impression was that the places where I grew up and studied at didn't allow me to see the natural beauties like this. So, that sky was quite an eye-opener for me. I really hope I could spend more days there to fully enjoy the feast to the eyes it brought to me.

地区特产

一个在我所在的地区比较受欢迎的产品是重庆小面，它是一种在重庆做出来的面。
Well, a popular product made in my region is Chongqing Xiaomian, which is a kind of noodle made in Chongqing city.

Unless any noodles in the southern part of China, Chongqing Xiaomian is mainly severed for breakfast purpose. The texture of the noodle is also quite different than those in the south. It is not chewy but still has its toughness. I usually eat it in a breakfast restaurant on my way to school.

It's not that hard for anyone to make this kind of noodle. You just put them into the boiling water for 20 seconds and get them out with a strainer. Then you can add some relishes or condiments. Before I saw a TV program that introduced the Chongqing Xiaomian especially, most flavourings were over 18 in some restaurants. For myself, I always add some pepper oil to add extra flavour, and basic condiments, like ginger, garlic and onion, which is important for the taste.

Well, I guess the reason why it's so popular is that Xiaomiao is so tasty. You know, the flavour suits the needs of the people in Chongqing city and even in other regions. Another reason why I think it's well-received is that the price of the noodle is affordable for the average customers. Usually, a bowl of Chongqing Xiaomian only costs less than 7RMB, which is cheaper than most noodles in the south.

花了我很长时间准备的一个礼物是中国结，我把它送给一个巴基斯坦朋友。
The gift that took me a lot of time to prepare is actually a Chinese Knot, which I sent to a Pakistani friend of mine.

It was like the third year of my university that I made this handcraft for the first time. During that time, I was quite busy preparing for the IELTS, which is an English requirement for overseas applicants. I got piles of English materials to do, which made me feel kind of stressed out. But, my life turned out to be not that dark when a Pakistani friend of mine came into my life. He was at our university as a PhD student of an international program. He just added some spice to my English studying process and gave me some kind of hope and constructive suggestions when I was communicating with him. And as a way of appreciation, I decided to make a Chinese Knot for him, expressing my best wished to him.

You know, I thought it wouldn’t be too difficult if I had followed the instructions, but it was. It was like assembling the furniture you bought from IKEA. It looks simple but kind of complicated to put the pieces together. So, it took me like a week’s leisure time to make it. The knotting process was kind of a suffer because it involved a lot of detailed work, but I actually felt a sense of achievement and enjoyment after I managed to knot the lines. So, it was indeed a pretty memorial experience in my life, I should say.

一个我想要和朋友分享的电影是《哪吒》，它是今年暑假新上映的中国电影。
A film I would like to share with my friends is actually Nezha, which is a newly released Chinese movie in this summer.

I watched it on 26 July with my little sister at the Wanda Plaza Movie Theater which is quite near to my house. We usually watch movies there to kill time.

This movie was mainly about a story of a Chinese legendary mythical figure named Nezha. He was chosen to be a reincarnation of a good spirit. However, it was replaced with the evilest spirit when he was born. The movie mainly depicted what his life in the human world was like and how he fought against his destiny.

Well, the reason why I want to recommend this movie to my friends is that it gives us some positive energy about life. You know, maybe we all have our own destinies. However, there are still some parts of our lives that can be changed to be good if our minds are set to be so. Another reason why I would like to share it with my friends is that this Chinese animation if of good quality and worthy watching.

一个让我印象深刻的广告是关于卖饮料的广告。是一个叫海南椰树牌椰汁的品牌。
Well, an advertisement I remember well was the one selling beverages. It’s a brand called Hainan Coconut Tree Milk.

I remember it was during the Spring Festival Gala of 2008 that I got to know this ad for the first time. You know what, the time during the Gala on TV was very precious, and usually companies from all industries wanted to bid for a chance to show their product. I saw this coconut milk commercial right before the gala began, so you know how dear that ad fees would be.

Honestly, the art design of the ad was inferior to their counterparts, but it stood out from them all by its impressive way of presentation. It just showed up the Chinese words of Hainan Coconut Tree Milk with a huge LOGO. I couldn’t see any animation, but can only hear a broadcaster announcing the brand name. The voice announcement was actually three seconds in length but was played for three times in one go, which lasted for nine seconds in total.

At that time, I thought it’s the worst ad design I had seen in my life. However, it really worked pretty well as when I woke up in the morning in the following days, the repeated magical voice was still lingering in my head.

The reason why I remember it so well is that this repetitive vocal branding just implanted into my head, making it difficult to forget.

一个我从旅游几个点带回家的东西是一条羊绒围巾，他是我在西藏购买的。
Something that I took home from a tourist attraction is a cashmere scarf that I bought in Xizang.

I remember it was about a year ago, I had a trip to Xizang with my classmates in college. We went to many places in both mountains and temples, but the most enjoyable experience happened in the mountains where there were lots of beautiful scenic spots.

We drove from countryside to local market. There’s a souvenir shop that caught us attention while we were on the road. So, we stopped by and visited there for a while. The shop was actually also a theme-based tourist spot where you could see many Tibetan animals. When I was about to leave, there’s a red kind of tartan scarf that made me feel so soothing. The style of the scarf was like those from the luxury brand but was way cheaper. So, I took it to the counter without any hesitation.

What made it so special was that this scarf ware purely made of the cashmere from local animals. You know, I just had a weakness to these cute animals. So, a scarf like this would definitely be my special memorabilia of this Xizang trip.

一个我最近掌握的技能是驾驶，我猜这个技能在我出国读书的时候是非常重要的。
A practical skill that I have mastered recently is driving, which is quite important I guess when I go abroad to further my studies.

It's a C1 driving license that enables me to drive on the road as a qualified driver. I learned this skill at the driving school affiliated to my university in Chongqing last summer. I clearly remember it was a sultry July. We were supposed to sit for a series of exams, including the knowledge test and two road tests. The training was intensive and the coach was somewhat impatient and strict to us. I had to follow his instruction attentively and practiced it at least two hours under the sun every day. What's made me feel difficult was that I had to stand by and wait for my turn for a long time, which was time-consuming. Anyway, I managed to pass this whole test with my effort and time.

The reason why I learned this driving skill is that I would be driving in Australia, which is the destination for my study abroad. You know, nearly every friend who has studied or lived there told me how important it is to be able to drive in that nation. It's like a vehicle is your second feet without which you can't go farther.

I'm really glad that I have mastered this driving skill. I know I will need to pass another driving test in Australia, but I think it's would be a piece of cake since I am at least qualified for driving here.

一件我喜欢穿的衣服是一件志愿者纪念T恤。
A piece of clothing I'm keen on wearing is actually a sports T-shirt that I obtained at a volunteer activity.

In this summer, I went to MT.Siguniang on my own for being a volunteer of a trail-running competition there. When we finished the event, all volunteers have obtained a series of souvenirs and the sports T-shirt made by the Ultra Gear with the event logo was one of that.

Honestly, I didn't imagine that we can receive some memorabilia there. You know, volunteers' work was really hard and un-paid. After three days' voluntary activity, we all felt tired but proud of what we had done. When the manager sent this T-shirt, it drew my attention. I picked it up and touched it to make sure its LOGO of this activity. After I tried it on in the fitting room, I was sure it’s for my size. Fun fact was that I almost wore it every day while I was at home even when it’s getting dirty. Now, I still wear it quite often.

Well, the reason why I enjoy wearing it is that this sports T-shirt is comfy and helps me keep energetic during I am running. Plus, its LOGO makes this T-shirt somewhat meaningful, you know, at least it helps me keep the precious memory of my days at MT.Siguniang.

一个我曾经去过的历史建筑是巴黎圣母院，它位于法国巴黎。
A historical building I have visited is Notre-Dame, which is located in Paris, France

I paid a visit there alone while I were attending an international conference during the summer of 2018 as it has been regarded as one of the must-see places in France.

Honestly, I didn’t take it seriously before going there because I knew nothing except for the little information from the book The Hunchback of Notre Dame and its adapted movie. But, when I was there, I was stunned by this grand Catholic cathedral.

As it was in a bay area, its height made it quite an eye-catcher. What I’ve learned the most was about the cultural perspectives. There were so many religious elements that I had never heard about. For instance, some sculptures depicted some scenes of the last judgment from the Holy Bible such as weighing the souls, which was so interesting. You know, I didn’t get much exposure to Christianity, but there’s indeed something equivalent like Yanwangyue (Key of Hell), who was also regarded as a power to weigh the good and evil. Also, the interior design of it was breathtaking, so many beautiful mosaics about those sacred stories.

Well, I felt this historical building was so meaningful to me as it gave me a brand new perspective of the world. You know, I also feel so sorry for the recent catastrophic fire that engulfed the upper reaches of this precious building of human civilization, I hope the renovation could carry on and finish smoothly.

我在电视上看到的游戏测试节目加《燃烧吧大脑》，由江苏省最大的电视频道JSTV播出的。
Well, a quiz program that I watched on TV was a program called the Puzzle Masters, which was broadcasted on JSTV, the biggest TV channel in Jiangsu Province.

It was a Chinese scientific reality and talent show originating in Germany. There were 100 contestants selected from the entire nation to show their talent on the screen. Each contestant in this show had to pass rounds of challenges with their counterparts so that they could ultimately have the chance to compete with those who represented different countries. The question designed for the contestants were extremely difficult and required much broader knowledge.

I watched this program nearly once a week last year to see how things went. You know, some of them had already been regarded as the so-called elites in other people's eyes. For example, there are many contestants from Tsinghua and Peking University which were top 2 tertiary schools in China. They got extremely high scores in Gaokao to be matriculated in their university programs. I quite interested in their performances in this show.

I was quite into the quiz program because it was educational and helped me broaden my horizon. I once regarded myself as a "straight-A" student, but I was actually quite shallow in mind after knowing those great minds from this show.
