这里要求的使用技能可以是非常贴近生活并提升生活质量的技能，比如会心算；
手机贴膜、系鞋带哒领地等技能。女生们美妆的技能。

一个我最近掌握的技能是驾驶，我才这个技能在我出国读书的时候是非常重要的。
A practical skill that I have mastered recently is driving,
which is quite important I guess when I go abroad to further my studies.

这是一个C1驾驶照，能够让我作为一个有资格的司机在路上开车。我是在我们大学的附属驾校学习的这门技能。那是在去年暑假那会儿。我清楚地记得那是一个非常闷热的七月份。我们得考一系列的考试包括理论知识测试以及两个上路考试。驾驶训练密度强，而且教练还有点不耐烦，
对我们比较严格。我不得不认真地听从指导，并没添顶着太阳联系不低于两小时的时间。让我觉得比较困难的是我不得不在旁边排很长的时间才能轮到我练习。有点点浪费时间。不管怎样，经过不懈努力我还是通过了整个考试。
It's a C1 driving license that enables me to drive on the road as a qualified driver.
I learned this skill at the driving school affiliated to my university in
Chongqing last summer. I clearly remember it was a sultry July. We were supposed to
sit for a series of exams, including the knowledge test and two road tests. The training
was intensive and the coach was somewhat impatient and strict to us. I had to follow
his instruction attentively and practiced it at least two hours under the sun every day.
What's made me feel difficult was that I had to stand by and wait for my turn for a long time,
which was time-consuming. Anyway, I managed to pass this whole test with my effort and time.

我认为我学习这项驾驶技能的原因是因为我知道如果我去了澳洲这个我要出国留学的地方。我估计要开车。几乎所有去那边学习或成活过的朋友们都告诉我那个国度驾车是如何重要。车辆就好像是我们的第二双腿，没有的话你去不了远的地方。
The reason why I learned this driving skill is that I would be driving in Australia,
which is the destination for my study abroad. You know, nearly every friend who has
studied or lived there told me how important it is to be able to drive in that nation.
It's like a vehicle is your second feet without which you can't go farther.

我非常高兴我能够掌握这个技能。我知道我去澳洲之后需要过另外一个驾驶考试，但是我认为应该不难，
因为我已经至少能合格驾驶了。
I'm really glad that I have mastered this driving skill. I know I will need to pass
another driving test in Australia, but I think it's would be a piece of cake since
I am at least qualified for driving here.
