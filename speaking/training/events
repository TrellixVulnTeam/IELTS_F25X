信息点：
锻炼身体的_活动_非常多。常见的如篮球、足球、羽毛球、跑步、游泳、健身等；不太常见的如网球、排球、高尔夫等。对于女生而言，甚至逛街也可以。
_健康_应该是现在大家都比较关心的问题。学生可能因为沉迷游戏或者学习压力太大，很少进行户外活动。
工作后的成年人可能一天到晚坐着不懂而出现过度肥胖、要算背疼等现象。相应的，各种活动可以使学生接触到新鲜空气，使上班族提升体质，克服就做的影响。

我要告诉你的考试健康的活动是慢跑。曾经我非常喜欢打乒乓球。但毕业之后，同学的工作都比较忙，大家很难找到共同的时间。而慢跑很方便，只需一个人，而且只要你想，在任何时间、任何地点都能进行。
The activity I do to stay healthy is jogging. I used to love ping pong back in school.
But after graduation, everybody is busy. It is almost impossible to find a shared spare
time. On the contrary, jogging is very convenient. You can do it whenever and wherever you like.

我通常会在晚上9点左右出去。因为白天还要工作。早上5、6点对我而言又太早。下班回来之后先吃晚饭，吃完饭消化一下基本上就9点了。因为我就住在大学附近。所以我通常都会在大学的操场上跑步。塑胶的跑道非常舒服，周围的学生让我想起自己的大学生活。
I usually jog at around 9 pm. After work, I would have dinner first and gave
2 hours for my digestive system to absorb the food. I know a great number of
people choose to jog in the morning before work. But 5 or 6 am is too early for me.
It seems to be a torture. Since there is a university beside my home,
their track field becomes my playground. The plastic track feels comfortable and
the students around remind me of my own college life.

跑步的时候我会穿上速干的T恤和短裤，专业的慢跑鞋。稍微热身之后就开始自己的跑步之旅。通常会跑5公里，大概半个小时。跑步之后我的身体素质有明显的提升。之前上两层楼都会剧烈喘气，现在上5层楼都很轻松。由于久坐造成的腰酸背痛消失了，头脑也清醒很多。我会继续保持下去。
Every time I go jogging, I put on the extra-dry T shirt and short and the professional running shoes.
Maybe I am not a professional runner, but I definitely look like one. After a little warming up,
I start my journey. Normally, it takes half an hour and cover 5 kilometers. This activity has a
huge benefit on my health. I used to pant like hell after climbing two floors,
but now climbing 5 floors is a small piece of cake. Apart from this, my backache also has disappeared
and my mind has become clearer, I will keep jogging.
