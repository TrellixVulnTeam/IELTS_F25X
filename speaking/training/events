我要告述你的经历是我在一年前找回了我的手机。那是个iPhone X，当时苹果公司的最新产品，非常昂贵。事实上，我存了5个月的钱才把它买下来。
The experience I am going to tell you is that I lost my cellphone and got it back a year ago. It was an iPhone X, the latest product of the Apple back then, very expensive. Actually, I had saved money for like 5 months to purchase it.

It was a weekend. After having dinner with my friends, I took a taxi to get back home. When I opened the door, sat on the couch and reached into my pocket on my trousers where I often kept my cellphone, I found it was not there. I hastily rummaged other pockets on my jackets but found nothing. It was gone.

I forced myself to calm down and started to recall what had happened. I clearly remembered that I had taken the cellphone out and sent messages in the taxi. And when I got off, I did not check whether I took it with me. So it must be left on the seat. Unfortunately, I did not have the driver’s name or the plate number.

But I did remember which company it belonged to. I searched the number of its customer service on the Internet and made a call. After asking a lot of questions about the journey and the item, it said my cellphone had been handed in by the driver and I could reclaim it at the office tomorrow. Hearing this information, I was flooded with joy. And I swore I would never lost it again.

我想说一说在我高中时期发生的一件事情。是关于朋友送的礼物的。
I want to talk about an occasion that happened in my high school. It was about a gift from my best friend.

I clearly remember it was in the second month of my first semester in high school. At that time, my friend visited my home and sent a mug cup as a gift for me, which printed a group photo onto it.

The moment I got home from school on night, my mother told me that the cup from my best friend was broken by my cat. In order to avoid some bad feelings, I bought a customized cup from nearby department store before long, and then put in my room again.

A week later, my friend went my home again to play with me. She asked something about my feelings of her gift, then I answered, "It is perfectly used." At that time, I did not tell her the truth of the mug cup. Still now, this cup is in my room. Although I have never told the story of this cup, we are always keeping in touch with each other for many years. I believe that our friendships are lifelong.

I think the reason why I did not tell my friend the truth is that I didn't want her to buy another gift for me or I wanted to let her feel our friendships without any accident.

我和家人一起做的休闲活动是徒步。
Well, a leisure activity I do with my family is hiking.

I's actually not a real hiking on the remote mountain but an outdoor activity that is considered to be safer and sportive as well. The destination is just two blocks away from our family. I remember it was during last October that we went there for the first time.

I do this activity with all our family members during the spring and autumn because we think it's a perfect outdoor sport that allows us to stay healthy by doing some physical exercises when it's nice day to go outside, as well as to feel the natural beauty.

We usually go there with general equipment in advance because the destination cannot provide us some necessary amenities such as sun hat, tent, picnic blanket, first-aid kit, charge pal as well as food, water and so on. Plus, we often consider all things about family members by planning the routes and make guides in advance.

Well, I definitely feel this leisure activity is awesome! You know, it not only gives us an opportunity to keep fit, but also enhances our family relationship through this activity. We helped each other by sharing our own strategies of hiking. I hope we could keep this activity on our list of leisure.

一个我从别人那里借来的好东西是一台E-R200BK卡西欧电子词典。
Something useful I borrowed from others was actually an E-R200BK Casio electronic dictionary.

I remember I borrowed it from a classmate of mine while I was studying in the third year of my senior university. At that time, I was busy preparing for CET-6 test and wasn't so confident with my reading test. I always found it difficult reading through the English passages without looking at the dictionary.

What made me feel bad was that flipping through the paper-edition was really a time-consuming thing. You know, my classmate Mo Yang noticed my situation, and lent his e-dictionary to me. That was actually the first time that I borrowed something precious from others.

Well, the reason why I borrowed it was that I thought I should try the electronic one at least for once to see if it could really boost my efficiency of study. Another reason why I borrowed it was that I was not so sure about an English item I was looking for at that time and wanted to check the definition out from another version of the dictionary. Well, the reality proved that it worked and I bought the same type of device a week later.

一个我和别人一起玩过的室内游戏是桌游。
An indoor game that I played with other people that I would like to share here was a board-game.

It was called Sanguosha, which literally means Three Kingdom Kill or the Legends of Three Kingdoms. It was during the first year of my postgraduate school that I got to know this game. It's a Chinese card game based on the Three Kingdoms period of China and the semi-fictional novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

I played this game with my fellow students in college. Wang Xijia who was the classmate that was supervised under the same professor bought this set of cards online. I still can remember how excited she was after she got the package from the delivery man. Right after she un-boxed the cards, we were invited to play. Once we got the ball rolling, we just couldn't stop. There's so much fun in it.

Well, the reason why I played this game was that my fellow student asked me to have a try. I didn't have any excuse to refuse. Also, I was quite into the novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and really wanted to see how it could be implemented into this game.

Well, this game was definitely interesting to play. It involved lots of game strategies without which you couldn't have confidence to win. I highly recommend this game as a way to have fun or kill time with friends.

一次我感到困倦但是不得不保持清醒的经历是在我去年准备期末考试的那会儿。
Well, a time I felt drowsy but had to stay awake was actually when I was busy preparing for my final last year.

I clearly remember that our math teacher helped us highlight a very wide range of categories regarding the Numerical Analysis on the textbook for us to memorize just three days before the exam. You know, we had mixed feelings during that time because we were happy that our teacher pointed out the essential part of knowledgeable that we were supposed to be tested and at the same time we felt it was nearly impossible to keep this vast amount of potential answers in our mind within three days.

I was pumped up to cram for the exam at the very beginning, but then I got worn out and pretty drowsy during the last night because there's so much to memorize and it consumed me a lot of energy. It's just like running a 5km or even marathon, you know the ending is approaching but somehow you cannot resist the temptation to have a break. But, thank Goddess that I stuck to it.

Well, the reason why I stayed awake was that this final meant so much to me. If I didn't prepare wholeheartedly, I would have less possibility of getting admitted into a scholarship.

一个庆祝成就的时刻是在几年前当我收到大学录取通知书之后。
A situation when I celebrated my achievement was after I got my offer from my ideal university several years ago.

The moment I got this thrilling offer, my parents decided to set a grand dinner to invite friends and relatives to come and celebrate. You know, they have been waiting this time for quite a long time.

It was on a summer day in the third year of my senior high school. I remember there were around 30 tables of guests from different places. My best friends also came to celebrate with me on that day. Well, my job during the grand dinner was mainly about talking. You know, I was supposed to deliver a mini-speech in front of all the audiences to show my gratitude to both my parents and friends for their strong caring and support. After the speech session, my parents and I went to different tables to drink a toast to them, which was not an easy thing.

Honestly, I felt quite exhausted after this event as I was busy welcoming and serving those guests all day long. However, that day was quite meaningful and rewarding to me. I have learned a lot from this celebration. I wouldn't be able to understand how lucky I was being a person who received a lot of love from others if I didn't participate in hosting this event of celebration.

我想要说一说我参加的一个让我无聊至极的聚会。
I am going to talk about a gathering I participated that made me bored to death.

This gathering was right after we celebrated the 2008 Chinese lunar New Year. As a custom, we were supposed to visit relatives and friends in the following days.

There's a time that my parents and I went to my mother's co-workers family to celebrate the festival. I thought that I would have much fun there, for example playing games with their kids who were at my age. However, when I got there, there were so many guests at their house, which made me feel difficult to move around.

What's worse was that the kids were all out of for fun before I came. So I did nothing but just sit on the sofa watching the boring Spring Festival Gala replay in a noisy environment where people were playing Mahjong while chatting loudly. I had never felt that life could be this boring being a guest.

Well, the reason why I felt so bored was that there were no peers in the house to play with me. I would rather go out doing nothing instead of staying at the house alone. If I were taken to that place again, I would bring an iPad or something to kill time.

我要告诉你的经历是我上周六到城市附近的山里去徒步旅行。这是我一直想做的事情。早餐之后，我打包了一些食物和瓶装水，穿上我最舒适的鞋子，乘坐公交车到达山脚下。徒步旅行就此开始。
The experience I am going to tell you is that I went hiking last Saturday in a mountain near my city, which was something I always wanted to do. After breakfast, I packed some food and bottled water, put on my most comfortable shoes and took the bus to the mountain foot. Then my hiking began.

It is a flexible activity. The difficulty varies with the hiking route you choose and your fitness level. As my main aim was to relax, I picked one of the most popular traits, which would not be too challenging. I took my time and wandered around. Every now and then, I sat on the ground and took a rest, chatting with other hikers.

The views along the route were wonderful. In front of me was the endless mountains and forests. Behind me was the lively city. There was also a shelter at the top of the mountain for visitors to appreciate the beautiful scenery of sunset. The air there also smelled fresher than that in the city, probably because it had little exhausted gas and fume.

I am quite into the experience. It provides me with a chance to take a break from the intensive course arrangements and heavy homework. After doing reading and sitting in front of the computer for a whole week, my body needs the fresh air and the exercise to get refreshed.

我要告诉你的经历是我第一次遇到爷爷的朋友。他是xxx大学数学系的教授，发了许多论文和好几本书。这是他在学术圈享有一定的声誉。我们现在仍然保持着联系。只要我在数学上遇到困难，我就会第一时间去找他。
The experience I am going to tell you is that I first met my grandfather’s friend who is a professor in the mathematical department of Chongqing Three Gorges University. He had published many papers and several books, which earned him some fame in the academic circle. We still keep contact now, and whenever I have some problems with maths, he would be the first one I turn to.

I met him at my grandpa’s house several years ago when I paid a visit and stayed there for lunch to do something chatting up. After the meal, he appeared at the door step and invited my grandfather to play chess. When one of them was thinking about the next move, the other would lean back, took a cup of tea and enjoyed it.

Learning that mathematical performance was not satisfactory, he seemed to be activated. He gave up the game they were playing and asked me where my confusion lay. I said the calculus we were learning was too complex and I did not have a clue about its various applications. He immediately drew a piece of paper and started to explain.

I have to say he was so much better than my mathematical teacher back in school. He was very good at relating the cold figures and equations to the colourful real world, which turned math into an interesting subject. After his interpretation, I felt I had completely mastered the relevant knowledge and even generated some interest in this subject.

我要告诉你的考试健康的活动是慢跑。曾经我非常喜欢打乒乓球。但毕业之后，同学的工作都比较忙，大家很难找到共同的时间。而慢跑很方便，只需一个人，而且只要你想，在任何时间、任何地点都能进行。
The activity I do to stay healthy is jogging. I used to love ping pong back in school. But after graduation, everybody is busy. It is almost impossible to find a shared spare time. On the contrary, jogging is very convenient. You can do it whenever and wherever you like.

I usually jog at around 9 pm. After work, I would have dinner first and gave 2 hours for my digestive system to absorb the food. I know a great number of people choose to jog in the morning before work. But 5 or 6 am is too early for me. It seems to be a torture. Since there is a university beside my home, their track field becomes my playground. The plastic track feels comfortable and the students around remind me of my own college life.

Every time I go jogging, I put on the extra-dry T shirt and short and the professional running shoes. Maybe I am not a professional runner, but I definitely look like one. After a little warming up, I start my journey. Normally, it takes half an hour and cover 5 kilometers. This activity has a huge benefit on my health. I used to pant like hell after climbing two floors, but now climbing 5 floors is a small piece of cake. Apart from this, my backache also has disappeared and my mind has become clearer, I will keep jogging.

我想尝试的水上运动是帆板，它被视为一项极限运动。
A water sport I love to do in the future is actually windsurfing, which is considered as an extreme sport.

Windsurfing is actually kind of a combination of sailing and surfing. I got to know this while I was traveling along the coastal area with my friends in Zhejiang Province during the summer. I saw strong guys hold a huge flag thing on the water surface, which immediately arose my interest.

I would like to try it in Australia in the future, but I'm not sure if I am allowed to do so. I know Australia are surrounded by many beautiful coasts, and it's got very good sea area for sailing.

I feel that windsurfing is not easy at all as I mentioned it has been regarded as an extreme sport. It requires both strength and skills. I assume the most difficult part of doing it is standing on the board while balancing the weight of the sail. You have to fully prepared, both mentally and physically, for the unexpected sea waves that come towards you.

Well, the reason why I like to try this water sport is that I think it's a pretty good sport to challenge my limit. This challenge helps me to develop my own courage and strength that are crucial for my entire life. You know life is like windsurfing, you may never know what kind of waves will come to you next, but you gotta prepare for it.

我想要说的是我和我的好朋友上个月看到以及听到的一位女士在打电话的事情。
I would like to talk about a lady that my best friend and I saw and heard talking on the phone last month.

If my memory was correct, we saw this lady in the Wanda Movie Theater of our city while we were watching the Avengers, which was quite a hit in China at that time. She was in red with some shopping bags in her hands and looked like a middle-aged woman. The first moment I saw her was at the entrance of the auditorium. You know her bags were so big, which immediately caught my attention.

Well, the first impression didn't give me some unpleasant feeling as it's pretty understandable watching a movie after shopping in this central business district. But. it was during the movie time that her behavior annoyed me a lot. There was more than one call she picked up during our watching time. I honestly sometimes didn't mind someone talking on the phone as it might be something urgent as long as he or she could talk in a low voice. The thing was that she used her high-pitch voice crazily yelling at a person on the other side of the phone as if there's only her in this public place. I couldn't remember what she was talking about, but it seemed that she was very angry and edgy, and her voice can be heard literally by all the movie viewer.

I was pissed off at that time. You know, she just ruined my favorite movie! I was a calm person but at that moment, I mustered up my courage to give her a verbal warning. You know she just didn't give a shit and continued talking her own business. That's pretty horrible movie experience for me.

一次我早起的经历是要去华山登山。华山是位于山西省华县的一个五星级自然景区。
Well, an occasion when I got up early was for a mountain climbing on Mount. Hua, which is a five-start natural scenic spot located in Hua Town, Shanxi Province.

I remember it was in the first summer vacation during my college when my friends and I went to the Mount. Hua for climbing. We were living in the downtown of Xi’an in advance, and it would take us 2 hours to get there. I clearly remember the reason why we woke up so early, probably around 4 am, is that we wanted to get a head up over the traffic and to be able to see the sunrise. Gosh, honestly, the last time I woke that early was probably for a day of military training in our high school. It took me a while to be fully awake, and I dashed to the washroom to wash my face, and wrap up all the stuff that we needed. As we were in a rush, we finished our breakfast on our way to the Mount. Hua.

The journey to that place was exciting because none of us had ever been there before. It’s like an adventure to a mysterious world under the sea. Nobody knew what this climbing would went. But, when we got there. It wasn’t bad. The scenic spot provided us a helmet with a flashlight so that we could see the road ahead. We ended up reaching the summit and seeing the sunrise, which was quite stunning.

It was definitely a great experience since I once again managed to challenge my limit, and this made me feel a sense of accomplishment.

一次我借助网络解决问题的经历发生在大三的冬天，那个时候我正在准备我的期末考试。
A time I managed to handle a problem through the internet was in a winter while I was preparing my final.

I was then a second-year student at my university and was enrolled in a course called Python, which was about programming. Even though we were college students, our teacher was strict with us and gave us lots of assignments to finish. You know, those assignments were not easy at all and often needed quite a while to finish.

I remember there’s a problem that kind of made me stuck for hours. I was supposed to design a mini calculator with some Chinese instruction. I was about to finish it after three hours of hard work. But the thing was that my finished piece was somehow not effective in making the calculator work. I checked all the lines of code and didn’t find anything wrong. You know, that was the day when this assignment was due, and I felt a little bit edgy.

I called my classmate Yang Ping, and he suggested me to search for the solution on Github, which was a platform for programmers. I googled it and registered an account of this website and posted a question regarding this issue. To my surprise, I got a responding thread 15 minutes and I was told that the problem would probably be the language translation issue. All I needed to do was to insert an additional line of code to run it. You know I ended up solving this question in just half an hour!

I felt so grateful that I was able to tackle this problem with the help of the Internet. I would definitely seek help from this website if I had more questions in the future.

An experience that the vehicle I took broke down during my travel happened this summer which I was with my classmates having a road trip in Sichuan.

I remember it was a very dry summer day. Two classmates and I were driving on a road in Xiaojin County, which was a county in the Abe prefecture of Sichuan Province. We were actually fully prepared for literally every aspect to this trip. You know, I even sat for the driving test to get a license before I came to Sichuan-Tibet highway so that three of us were qualified to shift if unexpected things happened.

Things went pretty well until we were about to leave this county. We got a flat tire on our way to Dujiangyan, which shocked me while I was on the backset. Obviously, we got a spare wheel, but it seemed that nobody had any clue about how to change it. We called the emergency number and had it changed.

Thank god that there’s nothing serious happened during that incident. The only impact this breakdown brought us was that the entire rescue consumed us an arm and a leg and three hours. So, we had to cancel a plan to a small scenic spot on our trip due to this breakdown.
